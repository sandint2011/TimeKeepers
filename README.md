# Installation & Setup

## GitHub

### Installation

1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/?ref=winstall).

    - If you prefer, you can install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) instead, but most students are less familiar with the commandline and prefer a GUI.

### TimeKeepers Repository

1. Accept the GitHub/email invitation to become a collaberator on the TimeKeepers repository.

2. In GitHub Desktop, clone the repository:

    - _GitHub Desktop > File > CLone Repository... > `sandint2011/TimeKeepers`._

## Unity

### Installation

1. Install [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

    - Unity Hub might require an update, so open it and update/restart if it asks.

    - Unity Hub might also require you to activate a license, so be sure to follow the instructions (there is a free license).

2. In Unity Hub, install the Unity Editor version `2021.3.10f1 (LTS)`.

    - _Unity Hub > Installs > Install Editor > 2021.3.10f1 (LTS) > Install_

### Preferences & Settings

1. Set the Play Mode tint to red (optional but helpful).

    - _Unity > Edit > Preferences... > Colors > Play Mode tint > `#FFA0A0`._

2. Set objects to create at origin instead of camera pivot (optional but useful).

    - _Unity > Edit > Preferences... > Scene View > Create Objects at Origin > `CHECK`._

3. Reconfigure the editor layout as you see fit. You can drag panels around and use the Window tab to add more panels.

    - I've made a layout with most of the panels we'll use; feel free to use it.

        - _Unity > Window > Layouts > Load Layout from file... > `Layout.wlt`._
